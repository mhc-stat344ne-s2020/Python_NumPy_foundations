This document is adapated from the [Python Numpy tutorial](cs231n.github.io/python-numpy-tutorial/) for CS231n at Stanford.

    "You can run a cell by clicking on it so that your cursor is in the cell, and then pressing the `shift` and `enter` (or `return`) keys on your keyboard, or by clicking the \"Run\" arrow in the toolbar at the top of the screen.  For a Markdown cell, this will just make the text look nice.  For a code cell, this will execute the code.  When a code cell has successfully run, a number will appear in square brackets to the left of the cell (the numbers show the order in which cells were run)."
